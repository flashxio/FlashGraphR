Title: Massive Graph Analysis
Author: See AUTHORS file.
Maintainer: Da Zheng <dzheng5@jhu.edu>
Description: FlashGraphR implements a set of parallel graph analysis algorithms
	for massive graph. It uses solid-state drives to scale to massive graphs
	in a single machine and achieves speed comparable to the state-of-the-art
	in-memory graph analysis.
