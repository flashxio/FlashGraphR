 * \brief Compute kmeans on matrix of features
 * \param matrix The matrix who's row IDs are being clustered.
 * \param clusters The cluster centers (means).
 * \param cluster_assignments Which cluster each sample falls into.
 * \param cluster_assignment_counts How many members each cluster has.
 * \param num_rows The number of rows in `matrix`.
 * \param nev The number of eigenvalues / number of columns in `matrix`.
 * \param k The number of clusters required.
 * \param max_iters The maximum number of iterations of K-means to perform.
 * \param init The type of initilization ["random", "forgy", "kmeanspp"]
