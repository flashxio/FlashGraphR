\title{Connected components of a graph}
\usage{
fg.clusters(graph, mode = c("weak", "strong"))
}
\arguments{
\item{graph}{The FlashGraph object}

\item{mode}{Character string, either "weak" or "strong". For directed
graphs "weak" implies weakly, "strong" strongly c
components to search. It is ignored for undirected graphs.}
}
\value{
A numeric vector that indicates the cluster id to which each vertex
        blongs to.
}
\description{
Compute all (weakly or strongly) connected components of a graph.
}
\details{
For an undirected graph, this function only computes connected components
and ignores the argument `mode'.

For strongly connected components, we use a customized version of the
algorithm described in the paper
