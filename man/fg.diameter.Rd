\title{Diameter estimation}
\usage{
fg.diameter(graph, directed = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{graph}{The FlashGraph object}

\item{directed}{Indicates whether or not to respect the direction of edges
in a graph when traversing the graph. It is ignored for
undirected graphs.}
}
\value{
A single number
}
\description{
Estimate the diameter of a graph, the longest distance between two vertices
in a graph.
}
\details{
This implementation uses the double sweep method described in the paper
below to estimate the lower bound of the diameter.
